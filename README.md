This repository contains an Excel-based HSE KPI data structure and a connected Power BI dashboard. Sample data is included to demonstrate how the registers, calculations, and visuals work together.

## How to Use

1. Download and open the Excel file.
2. Go to the **DataCall** sheet and update all names to reflect your organization:
   - Business Units
   - Sites / Projects
   - Departments
   - Owners, auditors, or employee names

3. Do **not** change column headers.  
   Column names are linked to formulas and Power BI visuals.  
   You may change values inside the columns only.

4. Update the register sheets using valid values from **DataCall**.  
   This ensures consistency and prevents errors.

5. Gradually replace the sample records with real data.

6. Open the Power BI (.pbix) file and click **Refresh** to load your updated data.

## Notes
- This is a working template provided for adaptation.
- The structure, logic, and relationships should remain unchanged.
- You may customize content freely to match your workplace.

## Sharing
If you choose to share your Power BI visuals publicly, feel free to post them on LinkedIn and tag me.  
I’d be glad to see how the dashboards look in different environments.
